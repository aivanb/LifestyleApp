## Modular & Reusable Design

### Backend Modularity

**Reusable Patterns**:
- Serializers with computed fields (`macro_preview`)
- Create-and-log pattern (can be applied to other entities)
- Access control pattern (owner + public visibility)
- Search and filter pattern (reusable for any model)
- Recently accessed pattern (applicable to other resources)

**Abstract Design**:
- Serializers separated from views
- Business logic in serializer `create()` methods
- Consistent response format
- DRY principles (macro calculation logic reused)

### Frontend Modularity

**Reusable Components**:
- `FoodCreator` - Can be embedded in modals, pages, forms
- `MealCreator` - Standalone or embedded
- `FoodLogViewer` - Dashboard widget or full page

**Reusable Patterns**:
- Macro preview card (can be extracted as component)
- Search with live results
- Item selection with servings adjustment
- Filter interface
- List with delete functionality

**Props-Based Configuration**:
- Components accept `onClose`, `onCreated` callbacks
- Flexible integration points
- No hard-coded navigation

## Macro Calculation Logic

### Food Macro Preview
```javascript
// Per serving
macros = {
  calories: food.calories,
  protein: food.protein,
  carbohydrates: food.carbohydrates,
  fat: food.fat
}
```

### Meal Total Macros
```python
# Sum of all foods × servings
for each food in meal:
    total_calories += food.calories * servings
    total_protein += food.protein * servings
    total_carbs += food.carbohydrates * servings
    total_fat += food.fat * servings
```

### Consumed Macros (Food Log)
```python
# Food macros × servings logged
consumed_macros = {
  calories: food.calories * log.servings,
  protein: food.protein * log.servings,
  carbohydrates: food.carbohydrates * log.servings,
  fat: food.fat * log.servings
}
```

---

## Search & Filter Implementation

- **Keyword**: Searches `food_name` and `brand` fields
- **Food Group**: Filter by category (protein, fruit, etc.)
- **Macro Ranges**: Min/max values for calories, protein
- **Visibility**: Automatic filter (own + public foods)
- **Sorting**: Alphabetical by food name

### Food Log Filtering
- **Keyword**: Searches food name and meal name
- **Date Range**: Start date, end date
- **Recent Days**: 1, 7, 30, 90 days (default: 7)
- **Meal Filter**: Filter by specific meal
- **Macro Range**: Client-side filtering by calorie range
- **Sorting**: Most recent first
