FOOD PARSING SYSTEM:
1. Input: a string containing one or more foods.
2. Send the string to the OpenAI API to identify all foods and provide metadata.
   - The API must return a JSON list of dictionaries.
   - Each dictionary contains a "name" and associated "metadata‚Äù
3. For each food returned:
   a. Check if it exists in the user's meals table.
      - If found, ignore metadata and log the meal.
   b. If not found in meals, check the foods table.
      - If found and no metadata provided: log the food.
      - If found and metadata provided do not match: log it and create a duplicate entry with a duplicate flag.
      - If found and metadata match: log it normally.
   c. If the food is not found in either table:
      - Use the OpenAI API to generate missing metadata.
      - If no metadata provided: generate all metadata.
      - If partial metadata provided: keep existing and generate missing metadata.
      - If all metadata provided: skip generation.
      - Insert the new food into the foods table and log it.
4. If the Create a Meal button is selected:
      - Create a new meal entry containing all foods from the current input.
      - If existing meals are referenced, include their foods in the new meal.
