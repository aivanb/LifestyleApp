--- Food Tracking ---
*Food is be logged at a specific timestamp along with meta data including the macros, vitamins, cost, brand, and serving size*

Created foods and meals are required to have all metadata filled
- Metadata can be filled in manually by the user  
- Metadata can be generated by the OpenAI API 

Food can be logged as either individual foods or meal consisting of many foods
- Individual foods contain meta data along with the user who created that food
-- Foods can be marked as public, allowing other users to view and log that food. Any personal information is not shared
- Meals consist of an array of foods alongside the user who created that meal

Users are expected to log all of their daily food
- Food can be logged by the user by selecting from the list of foods created by the user or other users if marked as public
- Food can also be logged by speaking or writing to a chatbot
-- The chatbot will search the database for the foods described by the user, then logged according to the provided servings 
-- If the foods or meals described by the user are not in the users food or meal database then foods and meals are generated and addded to the database

Users will have a list of goals for all metadata accociated with food
- Users goals will be compared with what has been tracked and the user will be prompted to meet their goal numbers
- If a user is consisting missing their goals by a large percentage they will be warned that they should change their diet

--- Workout Tracking ---
*Workouts are logged according to muscle activation rating. For each given split day, a certain activation rating is required to be met*

Muscle activation ratings are the main method in which workouts are tracked
- Workouts have associated metadata including what degree muscles are activated. 
- Every split should have a goal to how much each desired muscles should be activated.
- Each user has a list of muscles in the body and how much importance they feel each muscle should have

Workouts are expected to be logged every gym session 
- Workouts can be selected from a list of all the users created workouts. Workouts can be made public and will show for every user. 
- Each tracked workout will count towards to expected muscle activation rating for the given split day

--- Lifestyle Tracking ---
*Additional lifestyle metrics can be tracked and compared with gym progression*

Weight log
- The users weight should be logged regulary
- The user can set a goal weight, in which calorie deficite/surplus will be reccomended

Cardio log
- Intentful cardio can be logged by the user
- The calories burned by the cardio are factored into the daily calorie goals
- Cardio can be compared to gym progression

Water intake
- How much water the user drinks daily
- Is difficult to track so will typically not be used by other systems

Sleep log
- Users will be prompted when they first open the app (ideally soon after they wake up) to fill out sleep data
- Sleep information can be compared to gym progression
- If the users consistently has bad sleep habits they will be warned to fix them

Step log
- The number of steps per day can be logged at the end of each day
- Steps logged will factor into the daily calorie intake

Extra health metrics
- Extra daily health metrics that are not neccesary to track however are useful to notice long term trends
- Health risks can be caught early based on long term trends

Additional metrics will be calculated based on the users age, weight, age, ect
- Body mass index
- Waist to height ratio
- Waist to shoulder ratio
- Legs to height ratio
- Basal Metabolic Rate 
- Total daily energy expenditure
- Fat mass percentage
- Lean mass percentage
- Fat free body mass index

--- Additoinal logging ---
*Further logging is done in order to determine long term trends and catch abuse of the system*

API logging
- Tokens are tracked for each user to determine future cost projections
- API errors are logged to determine issues in system or abuse of certain features
- Request and responses to logged to determine trends or abuse of certain features
