- Only address the reported issue or error. Do not refactor unrelated code.
- Investigate logs, console output, or user-described malfunction.
- Before making changes:
  - Review related DEVELOPER.md docs for context.
  - Check for overlapping code to avoid duplication.
- Apply minimal, scoped fixes in the appropriate module (frontend, backend, middleware, or tests).
- Update or create tests (unit, integration, e2e) that reproduce the issue.
- Ensure all existing tests still pass.
- Run full test suite before completing the fix.
- Update agent-facing DEVELOPER.md with:
  - Cause of the bug.
  - How it was fixed.
  - How future agents should avoid similar issues.
- Update user-facing README.md if behavior or usage changed.
- Follow relevant STYLE_GUIDE.md for code, docs, and testing conventions.
- Never modify `.env` or environment configs unless the issue directly relates to configuration, and document such changes in /docs/ENVIRONMENT.md.
