- Add the feature with minimal coupling across backend, frontend, shared, and middleware.
- Backend:
  - Add or extend routes, services, or middleware with validation and error handling.
  - Follow backend `STYLE_GUIDE.md`.
  - Write unit + integration tests.
- Frontend:
  - Add reusable components/pages/hooks.
  - Follow frontend `STYLE_GUIDE.md`.
  - Write unit + component tests.
- Tests:
  - Add or extend E2E tests for the new feature in `/tests/e2e`.
  - Ensure tests are modular and agent-executable.
- Documentation:
  - Update user-facing `README.md` in affected directories.
  - Update agent-facing `DEVELOPER.md` in affected directories with integration notes to prevent duplication.
  - Update or enforce relevant style guides.
- Ensure industry-standard commenting (docstrings, intent-focused inline notes).
- Before completion, run all new and existing tests to confirm integration.
- End with a summary of what was added, tests executed, and docs updated.
