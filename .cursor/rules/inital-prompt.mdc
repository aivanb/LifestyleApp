- Scaffold a fullstack app with clear separation of concerns:
  - `/frontend` for UI and client logic
  - `/backend` for APIs, services, middleware, DB, business logic
  - `/shared` for types, constants, utilities
  - `/tests` for all automated testing
- Place reusable middleware in `/backend/middleware` (auth, logging, validation, error handling).
- Write modular, industry-standard documented code (docstrings, meaningful comments only for intent).
- Create automated tests:
  - Unit + integration tests for backend services, routes, middleware.
  - Unit + component tests for frontend.
  - E2E tests for all features (placed under `/tests/e2e`), modular and executable by an agent.
- Documentation requirements:
  - User docs (`README.md`) in root, frontend, backend, and tests.
  - Agent docs (`DEVELOPER.md`) in root, frontend, backend, and tests. Agent docs must prevent duplicate code and ensure integration with existing system.
  - Style guides (`STYLE_GUIDE.md`) in root, frontend, backend, and tests.
- Ensure style guides are followed for both code and documentation.
- Before completion, run all created tests and verify features integrate correctly.
- End with a summary of what was built, tests executed, and docs created.
